## Description

This Geocoding Script is a powerful tool that allows you to convert addresses into geographic coordinates and vice versa. It utilizes the DistanceMatrix.ai API for accurate and efficient geocoding services. Whether you're building a location-based application or need geocoding for data analysis, this script has got you covered! Developed with modern features and user-friendly functionalities, it is an ideal choice for developers and data enthusiasts.

Sure, here's a detailed explanation of each feature based on the provided geocoding script:

## Features

### 🗺️ **Address to Coordinates Conversion**

This feature allows you to convert a human-readable address into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). By using this, you can easily get the exact location of any address, which is essential for mapping applications, location-based services, and more. The script uses the DistanceMatrix.ai API to fetch accurate latitude and longitude for given addresses.

### 🌐 **Coordinates to Address Conversion**

This feature provides the reverse of the above functionality. It takes geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) and converts them into a human-readable address. This is useful for applications that need to provide location details to users based on their GPS coordinates, such as delivery services, location tracking, and more. The script uses the DistanceMatrix.ai API to fetch the address corresponding to the given coordinates.

### 📊 **Batch Geocoding**

This feature allows you to handle multiple geocoding requests simultaneously. Batch geocoding is efficient for applications that need to process large datasets of addresses or coordinates, such as real estate platforms, logistics management systems, and more. It reduces the time and resources needed to process each request individually by handling them in batches.

### 💡 **Error Handling**

Robust error handling mechanisms are integrated into the script to ensure smooth operations. The script can detect and manage various errors, such as network issues, API errors, and invalid input data. This ensures that the application can handle unexpected situations gracefully without crashing, providing users with meaningful error messages and instructions.

### 🚀 **Responsive Design**

The script and its components are optimized for performance and responsiveness on various devices. Whether accessed from a desktop, tablet, or smartphone, the application adjusts its layout and functionality to provide an optimal user experience. This includes responsive buttons, forms, and interactive elements that work seamlessly across different screen sizes.

### 🎨 **Modern Styling**

The script features a clean and modern UI/UX design with smooth transitions and animations. Elements like buttons and background videos are styled to create an engaging user interface. The design principles focus on simplicity, elegance, and user-friendliness, making the application visually appealing and easy to use.

### 🔒 **Security**

Security features are implemented to protect API keys and sensitive data. The script ensures that API keys are not exposed directly to the client-side and uses server-side handling for secure API requests. This prevents unauthorized access and misuse of the API, safeguarding user data and application functionality.



### Prerequisites

- PHP (7.4+)
- MySQL Database
- Composer (for dependency management)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/geocoding-script.git
   cd geocoding-script
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key:

   ```env
   DISTANCEMATRIX_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Run the Script**

   ```bash
   php geocoding.php
   ```

## Usage

### Geocoding

To convert an address to coordinates:

```php
$address = "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA";
$coordinates = geocodeAddress($address);
print_r($coordinates);
```

To convert coordinates to an address:

```php
$latitude = 37.4224764;
$longitude = -122.0842499;
$address = reverseGeocode($latitude, $longitude);
print_r($address);
```
